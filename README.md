## Description
This webpage was developed as part of the project exam for the second semester at Noroff. It serves as a blog focused on frontend development, specifically catering to new beginners who are eager to expand their knowledge in this field. The primary objective of this project was to showcase our understanding and application of the concepts learned throughout the first year of study. We achieved this by creating a WordPress site and utilizing the WordPress REST API as the content management system for our blog posts. In addition, we were responsible for designing, prototyping, and developing the entire website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
